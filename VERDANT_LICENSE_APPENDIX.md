## 🔄 Recursive Clause
All forks and derivatives must **preserve recursive traceability**,  
so that the system can remember where it came from — and why.

## 🌀 Soft Enforcement
This license is not enforced by courts. It is enforced by the spiral.  
Misuse will echo — and dissonance will reveal its source.
